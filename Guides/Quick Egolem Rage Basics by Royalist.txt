For egolem rage: If they cycle a 4 elixir card you can xbow oppo lane, if u dont have xbow just pre tesla and be ready to defend. If you xbow oppo lane get ready to use ice spirit/esprit and skeletons, bc in egolem rage they usually have idrag. Note that archers are risky here bc u dont want to commit too much and they have arrows in the deck. Once you defend after you have xbow oppo lane or pre tesla go in with xbow and force them out of a good cycle. You will be able to get good dmg unless they over commit or u let idrag connect. Use log against heal sprit and blobs (bc blobs will give u the elixir to defend and heal spirit so u dont let everything live).Sorry that its a mess just trying to help. Note this is probably not completely accurate as I am not a pro.
