How to stop golem first play with 3.0 based on BestNA’s gameplay and my own experience:



• Knight same lane at the corner of the map immediately when golem. [*they go night witch*]

• Tesla at the normal anti-fireball spot.

• If they give you value with golem+NW+something you fireball log (Espirit if you have it) everything then late knight if you really need it. Use Skeletons to distract something if you need to.

• If not, ignore the previous line, archers behind the knight to dps golem and nw (if possible). [*they nado the archers*]

• If they trying to snipe your tesla with a baby dragon, you want to protect it with a knight.

• If not, ignore the previous line, go knight to protect the archers from a nado.
