Minerloon: 
play passive in single. If they use Ice golem in the back you can go xbow oppo lane just be care to not over commit. 
In single at least i tend not to fb the musky as u can get punished if u cant take it off the board, but if u want to fb musky in single go ahead. 
In double u will want to xbow and tesla in the middle so when they go in with their push u can defend there are two ways it should go ur xbow lives or dies. 
If you xbow dies you play defense again until u have an xbow that lives with a good amount of hp, after that defense and you xbow is alive you can go in on offense and pressure them. 
if you have the elixir u can place tesla next to ur xbow so it can help with whatever they do to defend ur xbow and since they dont have a big spell its hard for them to kill it. 
After that offense you play defense until you have a surviving xbow from defense. 
In triple you will want to kill the muskys with fb you can do it in double too, but triple its a must at times. 
When time starts to expire with 30 secs or less left start to fb cycle. 
Dont do it at the start of triple bc u can get punished. 
For their miners try to use skeletons and ur spirit to eliminate as much damage as possible, u can use knight, but dont use ice golem unless you have to.
