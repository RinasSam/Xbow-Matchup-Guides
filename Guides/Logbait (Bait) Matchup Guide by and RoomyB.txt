Logbait matchup guide for 3.0 xbow

Single Elixir:
 - cycle cards in the middle instead of behind king when they have princess in cycle
- cycling knight can get them to play their knight which gives you a chance to kill it and then offensive xbow
- if they have recently rocketed your xbow, and go princess at the bridge, tesla and then xbow with it will likely get damage since they don’t have rocket in cycle
- Go in with xbow if you are even in elixir and they play goblin gang or princess or especially knight in the back (most wont do that) 
-only time to sack damage is if they have just used 6+ elixir  worth of bait at once, log whatever is most threatening and xbow opposite immediately, expect them to try using their building to kill this push 
-Fireball princess with tower even if your down 1-2 elixir they can’t rly punish you

Double elixir: 
- when you go in they will rocket your xbow and then probably cycle back to another rocket for your next xbow successfully many times. They will have a rhythm including many princesses in the middle of the arena protected by gangs and knight from your xbow. Log these princesses, and go in, this will be in a good spot because if they barrel you will still be able to defend it with archers + spirit or skeletons, and they will have a harder time defending

- sacking damage works less often during double because if it’s a similar situation to the one i described in single they will probably have enough elixir to defend still

-fireball anything they put next to the tower, fireball just tower too if you are up elixir, they can’t punish this, it will help you be ahead in damage  for tiebreaker 

General Tips:
- they like to princess the bridge at 0 right after rocketing your xbow since you have no xbow in hand and can’t punish, so be ready for a princess after they rocket your xbow. In general princesses are very annoying and it’s important to catch as many as possible, pretesla can help with this
