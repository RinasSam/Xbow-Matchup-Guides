Giant Graveyard Basics
Disclaimer: I am also not the best at this matchup so I cannot guarantee anything.

Neutral State
You usually want to keep a Tesla up most of the time. If you're even in elixir and you have a Tesla up, you're effectively always up 4 elixir. Tesla can always kill support such as Mini P.E.K.K.A and Musketeer, and helps a bit vs Skarmy. If they waste a Giant or you're up elixir and want to go in, you can Xbow with the inwards placement so that their Giant will also be taken out by your Tesla. As a result, I like to pre-plant Teslas quite frequently in this matchup.

You usually want to go in when they have a bad cycle (usually after a Giant Graveyard push), or when you're up elixir (either up elixir directly or with a Tesla on the field). You can outcycle Giants and punish their bad cycle quite easily, especially with Knight. This matchup is super offensive on both ends, so Xbow struggles to defend a good Giant GY push, and Giant GY will struggle to defend a good Xbow push / consistent Xbow pressure. You will usually need to let Xbows die to outcycle Giant and then overcommit to the one good Xbow push you get to maximize a lock.

If they Giant in the back in x1, do NOT Xbow opposite lane. Sometimes you can Xbow same lane, but it's even more safe to just full-on defend.

Defending GY
You usually want to mix up your Archer placements so that they can't Arrows the same spot every time. I like to cycle Archers early when they're building their pushes so that I can get back to a second pair after they kill the first pair with Arrows. This is very doable in x2. You also usually want to keep Log in cycle so that you can Log the GY after Archers die (wait a few seconds / for a lot of Skeleton buildup for your Log so that you don't waste value). Sometimes I like to Log the GY first and wait a long time on my Archers so that they can't use Arrows immediately and it might be too late by the time you play the Archers.
