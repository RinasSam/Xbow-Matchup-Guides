Opening game I overall play passively until the opponent does something so i can gauge the type of deck they are playing. 
Bhut golem: if they bhut in single snipe it with a middle defensive xbow bc the last thing you want to allow is them stacking bhuts. If they cycle healer or edrag you should go xbow oppo lane to pressure and try to not let them push. If you do not have xbow in cycle you will want to pre place ur tesla and get ready to defend as most likely they will try to push with their healer/ edrag. After you defend that push you can either play slightly passively or if you have the elixir xbow and put the pressure on them. They will either bhut or healer/egolem. Imo if they bhut you can defend ur xbow if they healer and egolem pre tesla and get ready to defend where you should try to go on offense after. In double it will be harder to get dmg so get log chip when you can, stack teslas on defense, and use ur fb effectively as its important in this mu. Usually should be saved for defense but you can use it on offense if ur in triple elixir, when fb on defense make sure u get healer and edrag, and emites so u can clean the blobs with a log, and ur tesla can deal with the healer and edrag.

Another important card are ur archers to be able to kill the edrag so protect them when you can as in egolem bhut bc they can kill them with edrag, nado, or barb barrel, so being able to protect them with ur mini tank is very helpful in this mu.
Sorry that its a mess just trying to help. Note this is probably not completely accurate as I am not a pro.
