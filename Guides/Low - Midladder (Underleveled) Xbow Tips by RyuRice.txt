Low-Mid Ladder Guide for Underleveled Xbow 2.9/3.0

General tips

- People in low to mid ladder are almost always higher level than you, so at the start of the game, you should be playing defensively.

- Cycle cards in the back (behind king tower) to feel them out. This is for you to be able to learn what kind of deck your opponent is playing.

- If you have archers, you can split them in the back, which is the safest play to make. You should save your skeletons in case your opponent rushes bridge unexpectedly

- If your starting hand is Xbow, fireball, ice golem/knight, and tesla, don’t immediately cycle ice golem/knight in the back. You should wait a bit until your opponent makes the first move because your opponent is likely to rush you unexpectedly.

- SAVE YOUR SPELL. Don’t just cycle spells without purpose. You should know when using a spell is necessary. You should try using troops to kill their spam if possible.

- People in lower trophy regions typically aren’t skilled enough to tank your xbow properly. They may also use squishy units. Always have your spells ready if you go for an offensive xbow

- Know your building placements. There are specific anti-spell placements to avoid giving your opponent value. Also, there are specific placements you should do in certain situations.

- You should know where to place your cards in order to get the most value.

-Know your numbers: When you are going to spell cycle your opponent’s tower at the end of the game, make sure you know how much damage your spells will do. This could ensure that you don’t accidentally miscalculate and leave the opponent’s tower with 20 hp after you use a valuable fireball on the tower. 

 
Single elixir

Many people in low to mid ladder aren’t patient, so they will normally start the game early, allowing for opportunities to punish in single elixir. You should take calculated shots when they commit.

-Use offensive xbows when they use a 4-6 elixir card in the back and see how they react to your xbow. Be prepared to use spells on their troops.

-You should almost NEVER use defensive xbows in SINGLE elixir. This is because most of the time, it doesn’t get value. You should only play defensive xbows in single elixir against huts.

-DON’T OVERCOMMIT.

 
Double elixir:

In double elixir, it is very unlikely that you will be able to get an xbow lock if you use the same tactics as single elixir, so you should play more defensively.


Triple elixir:

Here you should seal the deal.
Be sure to be in the damage lead. 

If you have a considerate lead on their tower just defend them as well as you can since tiebreaker will let you win.

If you are losing in damage, you should spellcycle your opponent. You don’t have to worry about saving your spells that much in triple elixir because you can easily cycle back to your spells.
However, be sure that they can’t punish you with anything before you spell cycle. It is advised to have a defensive structure before spell cycling.
