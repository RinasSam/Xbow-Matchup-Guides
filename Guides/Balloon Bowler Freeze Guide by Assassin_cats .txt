A guide to the lumberloon Bowler deck, based on BestNA's gameplay and my own experience.There will be tips on elixir x1, x2 and x3. 

Single:

•- How to respond to their first play:
BabyD: Cycle archers one lane or cycle to them, if you haven’t got them in your first hand.
InfernoD: Cycle archers one lane or cycle to them, if you haven’t got them in your first hand.
Lumberjack: Knight at the back same lane.
Bbarrel: Respond with skelies, spirit or log.
Bowler: Offensive xbow opposite lane.
Nothing: You can relax or cycle your log, skelies, spirit, archers (not recommended).

•- How to stop a lumberloon push when it’s played at the bridge: 
1A- Tesla one tile lower and to the side, where push is coming.
2A- Knight to the edge of the map, so tesla can lock on the balloon...or: 

1B- Tesla at the same spot. 
2b- Archers on the lumberjack and skellies to protect them.

•- If he went bowler first play and you went xbow, he will probably try to kill it, so:
If lumberjack: Skelies  and a spirit.
If Bbarrel: Skelies or a spirit.
If BabyD: Let the xbow die and defend it with a spirit and skellies when it crosses.
If InfernoD: Let let xbow die and defend it with a skelies and spirit   (if you need the spirit).

When their bowler crosses you want to defend it with only archers (place the right on top of it).


Double Elixir:

•- Remember: time is always on your side in this matchup (unless you are down damage), so you don’t have to rush with your offensive xbows if there’s no reason to do it.
•- Xbow opposite when they bowler.
•- You can go on the offensive if they don't have their bowler in the cycle.
•- It’s a good play to pre-place your tesla on the tile to the most damaged tower, especially, when they don’t have their ballon in cycle, but if they have it, you need to go with an xbow to pull the push to the tesla.
•- You pretty much just want to defend on x2, log chip, and go in when they’re overcommitted.
•- If their push looks too scary (like BabyD lumberloon) you can fireball it away from your tesla.

Triple Elixir:
•- Make sure that your pre-tesla is always up.
•- Go in when they bowler at the back.
•- Defensive xbow when they have a bowler in their push.
•- Try to take the juiciest fireball in your life on their push.
